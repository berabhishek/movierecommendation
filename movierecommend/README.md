# Movie Recommendation

This is an AI based tool that recommends movies based on current user ratings of the movies.

This project is implemented in Python (Django + Tensorflow) as one of the projects under the `100 days of ML challenge`

Currently, the backend of the code is not ready. We expect to go live by the first week of March 2k19.
